# Seismic Datafile Format Convert(Under preparation)
The main role of this tool is to realize mutual conversion between common seismic waveform data storage formats (e.g. SAC, MiniSEED, TXT, GSE2, SEISAN, Q, etc.).

# What is it?

Seismic waveform data have various storage formats (e.g. SAC, MiniSEED, GSE2, SEISAN, Q, etc.). Different operations for seismic data (such as data transmission, data processing for a certain purpose) need to use different data file formats, for example, the MiniSeed format is usually used for data transmission because of its small size advantage.

This project provides an interconverter between common seismic waveform data storage formats (e.g. SAC, MiniSEED, TXT, GSE2, SEISAN, Q, etc.). 


# How to use it?
This project provides different converter-functions between different seismic waveform data storage formats.
